# Abstraction and Encapsulation
A python programs that shows the application and concept of abstraction and encapsulation. This repository containes three different programs which are the fan class, car class, and fan class. 

# Fan Class
To display and retrieve the two separate characteristics of the fan, this application was developed. The properties of the fan program also include the fan's on/off status, speed, radius, and color.

# Car Class
The purpose of this program is to show the car's current speed as it accelerates and decelerates. The program called the accelerate method five times, and each time it did, the car's speed rose by five miles per hour. However, each time the brake method was used in this program, the speed of the car as it was braking dropped by 5. The brake method was also called five times. The year model, and make are two more attributes that this program has.

# Pet Class
This program was created to prompt the user to input the name, animal type, and age of their pet. This has three attributes, including name, animal type, and age.  Object-oriented programming is used in this program to improve the code's visual appeal.
